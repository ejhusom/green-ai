# Xu et al. 2021: A survey on green deep learning

A survey on various approaches for greener deep learning.

- Categories of approaches for green deep learning technologies:
	- Compact networks
	- Energy-efficient training strategies
		- Pre-trained models for initialization
		  - Efficient hyper-parameter optimization
	- Energy-efficient inference approaches
		- Pruning
		- Low-rank factorization
		- Quantization
		- Knowledge distillation
	- Efficient data usage
- Future work:
	- Deploying models on edge
	- Combining edge and clode: Dynamic network where edge devices handle simple samples with smaller models, and the cloud is responsible for handling complicated samples with larger models.
